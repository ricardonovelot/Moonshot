## About the Project

The Moonshot app, crafted as a milestone for Day 39 of the "Hacking with Swift" course, showcases the complexity and potential of SwiftUI for creating informative and interactive apps. This project dives deep into space history, using scroll views, Codable for data handling, and dynamic layouts to present information on space missions and astronauts in an engaging way.

### Features

- **Dynamic Data Loading:** Utilizes Codable to load and decode JSON data about astronauts and missions.
- **Custom Scrolling Layouts:** Moves beyond lists and forms to create custom scrolling views that adapt to content sizes.
- **Interactive Content Presentation:** Offers users the ability to toggle between grid and list layouts for viewing missions.
- **Detailed Mission and Astronaut Profiles:** Provides in-depth views for each mission and astronaut, including mission objectives, crew roles, and more.

### Learning Highlights

This project represents an advanced exploration into SwiftUI and Swift, featuring:
- Implementation of generics and constraints to enhance code flexibility and reusability.
- Advanced state management to toggle between different view layouts.
- Custom decoding strategies to handle complex hierarchical data structures.
